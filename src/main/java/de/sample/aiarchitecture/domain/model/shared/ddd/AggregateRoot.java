/**
 * Marker interface for Aggregate Roots.
 *
 * <p>An aggregate root is the entry point to an aggregate - a cluster of domain objects that are
 * treated as a single unit. The aggregate root is responsible for maintaining invariants within
 * the aggregate and collecting domain events that occur during state changes.
 *
 * <p><b>Domain Events:</b>
 *
 * <p>Aggregate roots collect domain events when state changes occur. These events are published
 * after the aggregate is persisted, enabling eventual consistency and loose coupling between
 * aggregates and bounded contexts.
 *
 * <p><b>Usage Pattern:</b>
 *
 * <pre>
 * // 1. Aggregate performs business operation and raises event
 * product.changePrice(newPrice);
 *
 * // 2. Repository saves aggregate
 * productRepository.save(product);
 *
 * // 3. Application service publishes events
 * product.domainEvents().forEach(eventPublisher::publish);
 *
 * // 4. Clear events after publishing
 * product.clearDomainEvents();
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param <T> the aggregate root type
 * @param <ID> the aggregate root ID type
