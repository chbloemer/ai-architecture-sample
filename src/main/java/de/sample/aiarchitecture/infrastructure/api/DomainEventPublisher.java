/**
 * Service Provider Interface (SPI) for publishing domain events.
 *
 * <p>This interface defines the contract for publishing domain events from the application layer to
 * the infrastructure layer, enabling loose coupling between aggregates and event handlers.
 *
 * <p>The application layer depends on this interface (in infrastructure.api), while concrete
 * implementations reside in the infrastructure layer, following the Dependency Inversion Principle.
 *
 * <p><b>Usage Pattern:</b>
 *
 * <pre>
 * // In Application Service after saving aggregate:
 * Product product = productRepository.save(product);
 * domainEventPublisher.publishAndClearEvents(product);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Benefits:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Application layer remains framework-independent
 *   <li>Events are published only after successful persistence
 *   <li>Enables asynchronous event handling
 *   <li>Supports eventual consistency across aggregates
 *   <li>Easy to swap implementations or mock for testing
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation Note:</b> Concrete implementations should ensure events are published only
 * after successful persistence to maintain data consistency.
