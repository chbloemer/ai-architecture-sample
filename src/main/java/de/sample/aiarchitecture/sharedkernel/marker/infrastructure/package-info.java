/**
 * Cross-cutting infrastructure annotations.
 *
 * <p>This package contains annotations that are used across bounded contexts
 * for infrastructure concerns that don't belong to any specific context.
 *
 * <p><b>Annotations:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link AsyncInitialize} - Marks components for asynchronous initialization</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Why in Shared Kernel?</b>
 * These annotations are framework-agnostic (pure Java annotations) and can be used
 * by any bounded context's adapters. The processing/implementation of these annotations
 * lives in the infrastructure layer (e.g., AsyncInitializationProcessor), but the
 * annotation definitions themselves are shared.
