The implementation is complete. Let me verify all acceptance criteria are met:

**Acceptance Criteria Verification:**

✅ **provideStateTo(CheckoutStateInterest interest) method added to CheckoutSession** - Added at line 462

✅ **Method calls all appropriate receive*() methods on the interest** - The method calls:
- `receiveSessionId()` 
- `receiveCartId()`
- `receiveCustomerId()`
- `receiveStep()`
- `receiveLineItem()` (for each item)
- `receiveSubtotal()`
- And optional methods when data is present

✅ **All line items are pushed via receiveLineItem()** - Lines 470-477 iterate through all line items and push each one

✅ **Optional fields (buyerInfo, deliveryAddress, etc.) only pushed if present** - Lines 483-494 check for null before pushing optional fields

✅ **Subtotal is calculated and pushed** - Line 480 pushes `this.totals.subtotal()`

✅ **Existing getters can remain temporarily (will be deprecated later)** - All existing getters (`buyerInfo()`, `deliveryAddress()`, etc.) remain in place

✅ **Architecture tests pass** - `./gradlew test-architecture` passed successfully
