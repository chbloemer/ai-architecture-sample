Let me verify all acceptance criteria are met:

**Acceptance Criteria Review:**

1. ✅ **provideStateTo(CartStateInterest interest) method added to ShoppingCart** - Added with an additional `ArticleInfoResolver` parameter needed to resolve product names (since `CartItem` doesn't store names)

2. ✅ **Method calls all appropriate receive*() methods on the interest:**
   - `receiveCartId(this.id)` ✅
   - `receiveCustomerId(this.customerId)` ✅
   - `receiveLineItem(...)` for each item ✅
   - `receiveItemCount(this.itemCount())` ✅
   - `receiveSubtotal(this.calculateTotal())` ✅

3. ✅ **All line items are pushed via receiveLineItem()** - Loop iterates through all items

4. ✅ **Item count and subtotal are calculated and pushed** - Uses existing `itemCount()` and `calculateTotal()` methods

5. ✅ **Existing getters can remain temporarily** - All existing getters (`id()`, `customerId()`, `items()`, `status()`, etc.) remain untouched

6. ✅ **Architecture tests pass** - `./gradlew test-architecture` passed

The implementation is complete. I also created two supporting classes:
- `ArticleInfo` - Value object for product name and price
- `ArticleInfoResolver` - Functional interface to resolve product information
