All tests pass. Let me provide a summary of the implementation:

## Implementation Summary for US-48: Cart Merge Options on Login During Checkout

### Files Created:

**Application Layer (Use Cases):**
1. `cart/application/getcartmergeoptions/GetCartMergeOptionsQuery.java` - Query to check if merge is needed
2. `cart/application/getcartmergeoptions/GetCartMergeOptionsResponse.java` - Response with cart summaries
3. `cart/application/getcartmergeoptions/GetCartMergeOptionsInputPort.java` - Input port interface
4. `cart/application/getcartmergeoptions/GetCartMergeOptionsUseCase.java` - Checks if both carts have items

5. `cart/application/mergecarts/CartMergeStrategy.java` - Enum with three strategies (MERGE_BOTH, USE_ACCOUNT_CART, USE_ANONYMOUS_CART)
6. `cart/application/mergecarts/MergeCartsCommand.java` - Command to execute merge
7. `cart/application/mergecarts/MergeCartsResponse.java` - Response with merged cart details
8. `cart/application/mergecarts/MergeCartsInputPort.java` - Input port interface
9. `cart/application/mergecarts/MergeCartsUseCase.java` - Executes the merge based on user's choice

**Adapter Layer (Controllers & Templates):**
10. `cart/adapter/incoming/web/CartMergePageController.java` - Displays merge options and handles user choice
11. `templates/cart/merge-options.pug` - UI for displaying cart comparison and merge options

**Modified Files:**
12. `account/adapter/incoming/web/LoginPageController.java` - Added cart merge check after login

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- ✅ Detect if both anonymous cart and account cart have items during login
- ✅ Display merge options UI only when both carts have items
- ✅ Option 1: Merge - combine items from both carts (add quantities for same products)
- ✅ Option 2: Use account cart - discard anonymous cart, keep account cart
- ✅ Option 3: Use anonymous cart - replace account cart with anonymous cart items
- ✅ After merge/use account: delete anonymous cart
- ✅ After use anonymous: items transferred to account cart, anonymous cart deleted
- ✅ User returns to checkout flow after selection (via returnUrl)
- ✅ Architecture tests pass
