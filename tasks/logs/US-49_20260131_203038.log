All tests pass. Let me provide a summary of what was implemented for US-49:

## Summary - US-49: Cart Merge Test Coverage

### Completed Implementation:

1. **Added `merge()` method to ShoppingCart domain class** (`src/main/java/.../cart/domain/model/ShoppingCart.java:332-364`)
   - Merges items from a source cart into the target cart
   - Handles same product quantity combination (quantities are added)
   - Handles different products addition (new items are added)
   - Preserves source cart (not modified)
   - Returns the number of items merged

2. **Unit tests for ShoppingCart.merge()** (`src/test/java/.../cart/domain/model/ShoppingCartMergeTest.java`)
   - **Same Product Quantity Combination tests:**
     - Merges same product by combining quantities
     - Keeps original price when merging same product
     - Handles multiple same products
   - **Different Products Addition tests:**
     - Adds new products from source cart
     - Preserves source item price for new products
     - Handles mix of same and different products
   - **Empty Cart Handling tests:**
     - Merging empty source cart leaves target unchanged
     - Merging into empty target cart adds all source items
     - Merging two empty carts results in empty target
   - **Error Handling tests:**
     - Throws exception when target cart is not active
     - Source cart is not modified after merge
   - **Domain Events tests:**
     - Raises CartItemAddedToCart events for merged items

3. **Integration tests for MergeCartsUseCase** (`src/test/java/.../cart/application/mergecarts/MergeCartsUseCaseTest.java`)
   - **MERGE_BOTH strategy tests:**
     - Combines items from both carts
     - Combines quantities for same product
     - Handles empty anonymous cart
   - **USE_ACCOUNT_CART strategy tests:**
     - Keeps account cart items only
     - Deletes anonymous cart
     - Handles missing anonymous cart gracefully
   - **USE_ANONYMOUS_CART strategy tests:**
     - Replaces account cart with anonymous cart items
     - Deletes anonymous cart after moving items
     - Clears existing account cart items before adding anonymous items
     - Handles empty anonymous cart
   - **Cart Creation tests:**
     - Creates account cart if not exists

4. **E2E test for full cart merge flow** (`src/test-e2e/java/.../e2e/CartMergeE2ETest.java`)
   - Tests the full flow: login with both carts, see merge options, select merge, verify combined cart
   - Created `CartMergePage` page object for the merge options page

### Test Results:
- `./gradlew test` - All unit tests pass ✓
- `./gradlew test-architecture` - All architecture tests pass ✓
- `./gradlew build` - Full build passes ✓
- E2E tests compile correctly ✓
