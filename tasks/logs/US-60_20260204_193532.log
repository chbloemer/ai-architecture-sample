## Summary

**US-60: Pricing Context ArchUnit Rules** - Implementation complete.

### Changes Made:
1. **Created `package-info.java`** for the pricing bounded context at `src/main/java/de/sample/aiarchitecture/pricing/package-info.java` - This enables dynamic bounded context discovery in ArchUnit strategic pattern tests.

2. **Fixed bean name collision** - Changed the `@Service` annotation on `PricingService` Open Host Service to use an explicit bean name `"pricingContextOhs"` to avoid conflict with the existing `pricingService` bean (from `product.domain.service.PricingService`).

### Acceptance Criteria Verification:
| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Domain has no Spring annotations | ✅ Verified - `ProductPrice`, `PriceId`, `PriceCreated`, `PriceChanged` contain no Spring annotations |
| Repository interface in application/shared | ✅ Verified - `ProductPriceRepository` is at `pricing/application/shared/ProductPriceRepository.java` |
| OHS in adapter/incoming/openhost | ✅ Verified - `PricingService` is at `pricing/adapter/incoming/openhost/PricingService.java` |
| All ArchUnit tests pass | ✅ Verified - `./gradlew test-architecture` passes |

### Full Build:
```
./gradlew build - BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```
