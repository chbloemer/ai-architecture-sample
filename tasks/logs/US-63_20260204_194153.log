Let me verify all acceptance criteria are met by reviewing what was implemented:

**US-63: Inventory Domain Events** - All acceptance criteria met:

| Acceptance Criteria | Implementation | Status |
|---------------------|----------------|--------|
| StockLevelCreated event (stockLevelId, productId, quantity) | `src/main/java/de/sample/aiarchitecture/inventory/domain/event/StockLevelCreated.java` with fields: `stockLevelId`, `productId`, `quantity` | ✅ |
| StockIncreased event (stockLevelId, productId, addedQuantity, newQuantity) | `src/main/java/de/sample/aiarchitecture/inventory/domain/event/StockIncreased.java` with fields: `stockLevelId`, `productId`, `addedQuantity`, `newQuantity` | ✅ |
| StockDecreased event (stockLevelId, productId, removedQuantity, newQuantity) | `src/main/java/de/sample/aiarchitecture/inventory/domain/event/StockDecreased.java` with fields: `stockLevelId`, `productId`, `removedQuantity`, `newQuantity` | ✅ |
| StockReserved event (stockLevelId, productId, reservedQuantity) | `src/main/java/de/sample/aiarchitecture/inventory/domain/event/StockReserved.java` with fields: `stockLevelId`, `productId`, `reservedQuantity` | ✅ |

**Summary of changes:**
1. Created 4 new domain events in `inventory/domain/event/`:
   - `StockLevelCreated.java` - raised when `StockLevel.create()` is called
   - `StockIncreased.java` - raised when `StockLevel.increaseStock()` is called
   - `StockDecreased.java` - raised when `StockLevel.decreaseStock()` is called
   - `StockReserved.java` - raised when `StockLevel.reserve()` is called

2. Updated `StockLevel.java` aggregate to use the new specific events instead of the generic `StockChanged` event

3. All events follow the established pattern:
   - Implement `DomainEvent` interface
   - Are immutable records with `@NonNull` annotations
   - Include standard fields: `eventId`, `occurredOn`, `version`
   - Have a `now()` static factory method

4. Build and architecture tests pass
