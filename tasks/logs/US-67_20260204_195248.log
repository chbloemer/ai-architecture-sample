Implementation complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## US-67: InventoryService Open Host Service - Implementation Summary

**File created:** `src/main/java/de/sample/aiarchitecture/inventory/adapter/incoming/openhost/InventoryService.java`

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
1. ✅ **@OpenHostService annotation** - Applied with `context = "Inventory"` and `description = "Provides stock information for other bounded contexts"`
2. ✅ **record StockInfo(ProductId, int availableStock, boolean isAvailable)** - Implemented as nested record with validation
3. ✅ **getStock(Collection<ProductId>) returns Map<ProductId, StockInfo>** - Implemented with empty collection handling
4. ✅ **hasStock(ProductId, int quantity) returns boolean** - Implemented, returns true if availableStock >= quantity
5. ✅ **Delegates to GetStockForProductsUseCase** - Injects `GetStockForProductsInputPort` and delegates all operations

**Pattern Compliance:**
- Follows the same OHS pattern as `PricingService` and `ProductCatalogService`
- Located in `adapter/incoming/openhost/` as required by architecture rules
- Uses `@Service("inventoryContextOhs")` bean naming convention
- Includes comprehensive JavaDoc documentation
- All architecture tests pass (OHS, Hexagonal, Strategic DDD patterns)

**Note:** The pre-existing architecture test failure for `CheckoutValidationResult` is unrelated to this implementation.
