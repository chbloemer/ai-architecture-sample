The implementation is complete. Let me verify all acceptance criteria are met:

**US-74: CompositeArticleDataAdapter - Acceptance Criteria Verification:**

| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| ✅ Implements ArticleDataPort | Line 35: `implements ArticleDataPort` |
| ✅ Injects ProductCatalogService | Line 37 + constructor injection (lines 41-48) |
| ✅ Injects PricingService | Line 38 + constructor injection (lines 41-48) |
| ✅ Injects InventoryService | Line 39 + constructor injection (lines 41-48) |
| ✅ Fetches from all three services | Lines 57-58, 64, 88, 95-96: calls all three OHS |
| ✅ Combines into ArticleData | Lines 68-74, 98-103: combines data via `combineData()` method |
| ✅ Handles missing data gracefully | Lines 109-136: falls back to ProductCatalogService data when pricing/inventory is missing |

All acceptance criteria are satisfied:
- The adapter implements `ArticleDataPort` 
- It injects all three Open Host Services (ProductCatalogService, PricingService, InventoryService)
- It fetches data from all three services and combines them into `ArticleData`
- Missing data is handled gracefully with fallbacks to ProductCatalogService data
