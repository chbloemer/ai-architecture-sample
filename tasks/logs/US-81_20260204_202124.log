All tests pass. Let me verify the implementation meets all the acceptance criteria:

**Acceptance Criteria Verification:**

1. ✅ **Implements CheckoutArticleDataPort** - The class `implements CheckoutArticleDataPort` (line 35)

2. ✅ **Injects: ProductCatalogService, PricingService, InventoryService** - All three services are injected via constructor (lines 37-48)

3. ✅ **Same pattern as Cart's CompositeArticleDataAdapter** - Follows the same pattern:
   - Uses `@Component` annotation
   - Constructor injection for all three services
   - Bulk fetch from pricing and inventory services
   - Individual fetch from product catalog
   - Graceful fallback logic in `combineData()` method
   - Only place in checkout context importing from other bounded contexts

The implementation is complete and all tests pass.

<promise>STORY_COMPLETE</promise>
