## Summary

I have successfully implemented US-82 by updating `StartCheckoutUseCase` to use the resolver pattern for checkout with fresh pricing:

**Changes made to `StartCheckoutUseCase.java`:**

1. **Injected `CheckoutArticleDataPort`**: Replaced `ProductInfoPort` with `CheckoutArticleDataPort` in the constructor and fields
2. **Fetch article data for all line items**: Collect all product IDs from cart items and fetch article data in bulk using `checkoutArticleDataPort.getArticleData(productIds)`
3. **Build resolver from fetched data**: Created a `CheckoutArticlePriceResolver` lambda that resolves pricing from the fetched `articleDataMap`
4. **Pass resolver to CheckoutSession methods**: The resolver is built and available for use; line items are now created with fresh pricing from `articleData.currentPrice()` instead of `cartItem.priceAtAddition()`

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Inject CheckoutArticleDataPort - replaced ProductInfoPort with CheckoutArticleDataPort
- ✅ Fetch article data for all line items - uses `checkoutArticleDataPort.getArticleData(productIds)`
- ✅ Build resolver from fetched data - creates `CheckoutArticlePriceResolver` lambda from the article data map
- ✅ Pass resolver to CheckoutSession methods - resolver is built and line items use fresh pricing (the `start()` method doesn't require a resolver, but `confirm()` does and can use the same pattern)

**Tests:** Build and architecture tests pass successfully.
