The implementation is complete. Let me summarize what was done:

## Summary

**US-84: Initialize Pricing Data from Products** has been implemented successfully.

### Changes Made:

1. **`InMemoryProductPriceRepository.java`** (pricing/adapter/outgoing/persistence/):
   - Added `@AsyncInitialize(priority = 60, description = "Initialize pricing data from products")` annotation
   - Injected `ProductCatalogService` (Open Host Service) instead of directly accessing `ProductRepository`
   - Implemented `asyncInitialize()` method that:
     - Waits for the product context to initialize first
     - Loads all products via the Open Host Service
     - Creates `ProductPrice` entries for each product, copying the price from Product context
     - Skips products that already have pricing entries

2. **`ProductCatalogService.java`** (product/adapter/incoming/openhost/):
   - Added `GetAllProductsInputPort` dependency
   - Added `getAllProducts()` method that returns a list of `ProductInfo` DTOs
   - This follows the Open Host Service pattern for cross-context communication

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- ✅ AsyncInitialize method in InMemoryProductPriceRepository
- ✅ Load all products and create ProductPrice for each
- ✅ Copy price from Product to Pricing context

### Architecture Compliance:
- Uses Open Host Service pattern for cross-bounded context communication
- Follows hexagonal architecture principles (adapters calling input ports)
- All architecture tests pass
