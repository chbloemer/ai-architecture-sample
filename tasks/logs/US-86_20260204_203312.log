All unit tests and architecture tests pass. Let me provide a summary of the changes made for US-86:

## Summary of Changes for US-86 - Update Product Context - Remove Pricing Responsibility

### Acceptance Criteria Met:

1. **✅ Deprecate price-related methods in Product aggregate**
   - `Product.price()` marked `@Deprecated(forRemoval = true)` with message to use PricingService
   - `Product.changePrice()` marked `@Deprecated(forRemoval = true)` with message to use ProductPriceRepository
   - Price field kept in Product for now (as specified in acceptance criteria)

2. **✅ ProductCatalogService OHS returns name/SKU only (not price)**
   - `ProductInfo` record updated to contain: `productId`, `name`, `sku`, `availableStock` (price removed)
   - `getProductInfo()` and `getAllProducts()` updated to exclude price
   - Added deprecated `ProductInfoWithPrice` and `getAllProductsWithInitialPrice()` for transition period

3. **✅ Update ProductDataPort in Cart to not expect pricing**
   - `ProductData` record updated to contain: `productId`, `hasStock` (price removed)
   - Documentation updated to indicate pricing comes from `ArticleDataPort`

4. **✅ Keep Price in Product for now (remove in future story)**
   - Price field remains in Product aggregate
   - All deprecated methods and migration code clearly marked for future removal

### Additional Changes (Required for Consistency):

- **AddItemToCartUseCase**: Updated to get pricing from `ArticleDataPort` instead of `ProductDataPort`
- **ProductDataAdapter**: Updated to work without price field
- **CompositeArticleDataAdapter** (Cart): Updated with fallback to Product context during transition
- **CompositeCheckoutArticleDataAdapter** (Checkout): Updated with same fallback pattern
- **ProductCreatedEventConsumer**: New component in Pricing context to sync prices for new products

### Test Results:
- Unit tests: ✅ Pass
- Architecture tests: ✅ Pass  
- Checkout flow integration tests: ✅ Pass
- One unrelated test failure in `ShoppingCartRepositoryJpaIntegrationTest` (pre-existing test isolation issue)
