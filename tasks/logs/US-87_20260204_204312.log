I have successfully implemented US-87 - Integration Tests for Article Data Flow. Here's a summary of what was created:

## Summary

Created `ArticleDataFlowIntegrationTest.java` in `src/test-integration/java/de/sample/aiarchitecture/` with comprehensive tests covering all acceptance criteria:

### Test Coverage

1. **CompositeArticleDataAdapter Tests** (5 tests)
   - Verifies aggregation of data from all three OHS services (ProductCatalogService, PricingService, InventoryService)
   - Tests bulk fetch of article data for multiple products
   - Tests edge cases (empty input, unknown product)
   - Verifies proper adapter wiring

2. **StartCheckoutUseCase with Resolver Tests** (2 tests)
   - Verifies fresh pricing from CheckoutArticleDataPort when starting checkout
   - Verifies product name from ProductCatalogService in line items

3. **ConfirmCheckoutUseCase with Resolver Tests** (2 tests)
   - Validates pricing with resolver during confirmation
   - Verifies resolver fetches fresh pricing during confirmation

4. **GetCartByIdUseCase Enrichment Tests** (2 tests)
   - Verifies cart items are enriched with fresh pricing data
   - Verifies both price at addition and current price are included

5. **Price Change Detection Tests** (3 tests)
   - Detects when price has not changed
   - Detects when price has changed (using SetProductPriceInputPort)
   - Verifies price change detection works for multiple items

6. **End-to-End Article Data Flow Tests** (2 tests)
   - Complete flow: Cart → Checkout → Confirm with fresh pricing at each step
   - Verifies all three OHS services are accessible

### Build Status
- All 17 new integration tests pass
- Unit tests pass
- Architecture tests pass
- Note: There is one pre-existing failing test (`ShoppingCartRepositoryJpaIntegrationTest.findBy_spec_withMinTotal_andActive_paginatesAndFilters`) that was already failing before these changes
