All acceptance criteria have been fulfilled:

**Key Changes Summary:**
- **Product aggregate** no longer holds price - it's fully managed by the Pricing bounded context
- **ProductCreated event** carries the initial price for the Pricing context to pick up
- **GetAllProductsUseCase** and **GetProductByIdUseCase** now fetch prices via `PricingDataPort`
- **SampleDataInitializer** moved to `infrastructure.init` package to allow cross-context data initialization
- The pricing migration from US-83 through US-88 is now complete
