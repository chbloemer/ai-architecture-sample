# RALPH Progress Log
# Project: Checkout Bounded Context
# Started: 2026-01-29

## Overview
Implementing a multi-step checkout flow with:
- Guest checkout (no account required)
- 5-step flow: Buyer Info → Delivery → Payment → Review → Confirmation
- Payment provider plugin architecture
- Step validation with automatic redirects

## Key Learnings

### Project Patterns
- Use BaseAggregateRoot for aggregates (see cart/domain/model/ShoppingCart.java)
- Use Case pattern: InputPort → UseCase → Command/Query → Response
- Repositories in application/shared, implementations in adapter/outgoing/persistence
- Controllers use Pug templates in src/main/resources/templates/

### Shared Kernel
- Money value object at sharedkernel/domain/common/Money.java
- ProductId at sharedkernel/domain/common/ProductId.java
- Marker interfaces at sharedkernel/domain/marker/

### Cart Context References
- CartId, CustomerId in cart/domain/model/
- ShoppingCart aggregate for reference pattern
- CartPageController for web controller pattern
